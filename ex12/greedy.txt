The difference between the 0/1 and the fractional version of the Knapsack problem is the following:
At the 0/1 version we want to pick each item either fully or we don't pick it. At the
fractional version we can take a part of the item. The Greedy choice property is states
as:
"We choose at each step the 'best' item, which is the one with the greatest benefit and the
smallest weight. We do the same choice until the Knapsack is full or there aren't any objects
that fill in the Knapsack."
The greedy algorithm works for the fractional knapsack problem because the globally optimal
choice is to take the item with the largest value/weight. The greedy choice property holds here.
In 0/1 Knapsack, this property no longer holds. For example let the knapsack capacity be W=c,
and have n=2 items. Also let w1=c and p1=c−1, and w2=1 and p2=1. The greedy algorithm will
select only item 2, but the optimal solution contains only item 1. Meaning that
the solution we obtain is (c−1) times as bad as the true optimum. That is arbitrarily bad, even
if you wanted to approximate the optimum. The greedy algorithm works because we can “cut up”
items to fill the rest of the knapsack, you cannot do that in the 0/1 case.
